      <p>The Akan people of Ghana frequently name their children after the day of the week they were born and the order in which they were born.
         <br>These "day names" have further meanings concerning the soul and character of the person. 
         <br>Middle names have considerably more variety and can refer to their birth order, twin status, or an ancestor's middle name.</p>
